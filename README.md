## Celery

### Configuration

We use *redis* as a message brocker and end point for celery. The idea is to have a single worker responsible for the
execution of any type of test involving code submissions (students) or excercise creation (teachers).

### Tasks

#### `test_code`

The `test_code` functional task is responsible for executing the `run_test` function from the `CodeTestingService`.

The task takes in the id of the CodeSubmission object by the user. This `submission_id` is used to retrieve the code,
then the code is tested using the `run_test` that checks _several system security checks_ beside testing the code with
the corresponding set of unittest cases assigned to the `Excercise`.

## Testing service

The `CodeTestingService` is a class that is responsible for retrieving the `Excercise` corresponding to the
`submission_id` generated by the code submission. Then, it gets the test cases from the `Excercise` and runs them to
test the submitted code. In the proccess, the service creates a temporary directory to store the code and the test
cases, checks the code for security issues, runs the test cases and deletes the temporary files.
